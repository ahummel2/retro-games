two maps, background and movable elements
draw should check for elements then fall back to background
rely on pygame.tick to move obstacles around mostly
  will need to adapt the display process to handle smooth movement and hitboxes
movement for frogger is obvious
hitboxes is new but shouldn't be that weird
new win condition and level mechanics
lives, though that's easy to implement
